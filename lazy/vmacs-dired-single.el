;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  `vmacs-single-dired.el' can make you just open a single dired buffer.
;;  I bind `dired-mouse-find-alternate-file' on [mouse-2]
;;  so even you click on a directory in dired buffer ,
;;  it will reuse current dired buffer too.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  (with-eval-after-load 'dired (require 'vmacs-single-dired))
