;; Description:
;;
;; Provides the command vterm-toggle which toggles between the
;; vterm buffer and whatever buffer you are editing.
;;
;; This is done in an "intelligent" way.  Features are:
;; o Starts a vterm if none is existent.
;; o Minimum distortion of your window configuration.
;; o When done in the vterm-buffer you are returned to the same window
;;   configuration you had before you toggled to the shell.
;; o If you desire, you automagically get a "cd" command in the shell to the
;;   directory where your current buffers file exists( even in a ssh session); just call
;;   vterm-toggle-cd instead of vterm-toggle.
;;
