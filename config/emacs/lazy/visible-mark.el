;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs minor mode to highlight mark(s).
;;
;; Allows setting the number of marks to display, and the faces to display them.
;;
;; A good blog post was written introducing this package:
;; http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/regions-marks-and-visual-mark/
;;
;; Example installation:
;;
;; 1. Put this file in Emacs's load-path
;;
;; 2. add custom faces to init file
;; (require 'visible-mark)
;; (global-visible-mark-mode 1) ;; or add (visible-mark-mode) to specific hooks
;;
;; 3. Add customizations. The defaults are very minimal. They could also be set
;; via customize.
;; 
;; (defface visible-mark-active ;; put this before (require 'visible-mark)
;;   '((((type tty) (class mono)))
;;     (t (:background "magenta"))) "")
;; (setq visible-mark-max 2)
;; (setq visible-mark-faces `(visible-mark-face1 visible-mark-face2))
;; 
;;
;; Additional useful functions like unpoping the mark are at
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MarkCommands
;; and http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/VisibleMark

;; Known bugs
;;
;; Observed in circe, when the buffer has a right margin, and there
;; is a mark at the beginning of a line, any text in the margin on that line
;; gets styled with the mark's face. May also happen for left margins, but
;; haven't tested yet.
;;
;; Patches / pull requests / feedback welcome.
