SafariSGP
=========

SafariSGP helps you generate your [SuperGenPass](http://supergenpass.com) passwords conveniently.

This extension adds a button to the Safari toolbar. Clicking this button shows the mobile version of SuperGenPass prepopulated with the current domain. Fill in your master password and click "Generate" to show the generated password. This will also fill in the password field in your page with the generated password.
