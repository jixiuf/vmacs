# This is the configuration for libtsocks (transparent socks)
# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored
#
# This sample configuration shows the simplest (and most common) use of
# tsocks. This is a basic LAN, this machine can access anything on the 
# local ethernet (192.168.0.*) but anything else has to use the SOCKS version
# 4 server on the firewall. Further details can be found in the man pages,
# tsocks(8) and tsocks.conf(5) and a more complex example is presented in 
# tsocks.conf.complex.example

# We can access 192.168.0.* directly
local = 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

# Otherwise we use the server

server = 127.0.0.1
server_type = 5    #to use socks V5
server_port = 7070  #the port of your porxy%
