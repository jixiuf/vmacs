;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides rg isearch integration.
;; Add this to your configuration to bind chosen key in isearch minibuffer:
;;
;; (define-key isearch-mode-map "\M-sr" 'rg-isearch-menu)
;;

;; See info node `(rgel)Isearch search' for documentation or online at https://rgel.readthedocs.io/.

;;; Code:

(require 'rg)

(defun rg-get-isearch-string ()
  "Extract the isearch string from the last isearch."
  ;; Mimic what `isearch-occur' does.
  (or (cond
       ;; We can't handle arbitrary functions so just use the string.
       ((functionp isearch-regexp-function) isearch-string)
       ;; isearch-occur handles this as word search so insert word boundary
       (isearch-regexp-function (concat "\b" isearch-string "\b"))
       (isearch-regexp isearch-string)
       (t isearch-string))
      ""))
