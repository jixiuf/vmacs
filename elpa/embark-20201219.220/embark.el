;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a sort of right-click contextual menu for Emacs,
;; accessed through the `embark-act' command (which you should bind to a
;; convenient key), offering you relevant /actions/ to use on a /target/
;; determined by the context:

;; - In the minibuffer, the target is the current best completion
;;  candidate.
;; - In the `*Completions*' buffer the target is the completion at point.
;; - In a regular buffer, the target is the region if active, or else the
;;  file, symbol or url at point.

;; The type of actions offered depend on the type of the target:

;; - For files you get offered actions like deleting, copying,
;;  renaming, visiting in another window, running a shell command on the
;;  file, etc.
;; - For buffers the actions include switching to or killing the buffer.
;; - For package names the actions include installing, removing or
;;  visiting the homepage.

;; Everything is easily configurable: determining the current target,
;; classifying it, and deciding with actions are offered for each type
;; in the classification. The above introduction just mentions part of
;; the default configuration.

;; Configuring which act are offered for a type is particularly easy and
;; requires no programming: the variable `embark-keymap-alist' associates
;; target types with variable containing keymaps, and those keymaps
;; containing binds for the actions. For example, in the default
;; configuration the type `file' is associated with the symbol
;; `embark-file-keymap'. That symbol names a keymap with single-letter
;; keybindings for common Emacs file commands, for instance `c' is bound
;; to `copy-file'. This means that if while you are in the minibuffer
;; after running a command that prompts for a file, such as `find-file' or
;; `rename-file', you can copy a file by running `embark-act' and then
;; pressing `c'.

;; These action keymaps are very convenient but not strictly necessary
;; when using `embark-act': you can use any command that reads from the
;; minibuffer as an action and the target of the action will be inserted
;; at the first minibuffer prompt. After running `embark-act' all of your
;; keybindings and even `execute-extended-command' can be used to run a
;; command.

;; The actions in `embark-general-map' are available no matter what
;; type of completion you are in the middle of. By default this
;; includes bindings to save the current candidate in the kill ring
;; and to insert the current candidate in the previously selected
;; buffer (the buffer that was current when you executed a command
;; that opened up the minibuffer).

;; You can read about the Embark GitHub project wiki:
;; https://github.com/oantolin/embark/wiki/Default-Actions

;; Besides acting individually on targets, Embark lets you work
;; collectively on a set of target /candidates/. For example, while you are
;; in the minibuffer the candidates are simply the possible completions
;; of your input. Embark provides two commands to work on candidate sets:

;; - The `embark-occur' command produces a buffer listing all candidates,
;;  for you to peruse and run actions on at your leisure. The
;;  candidates can be viewed in a grid or as a list showing additional
;;  annotations. The `embark-live-occur' variant produces "live" Embark
;;  Occur buffer, meaning they autoupdate as the set of candidates
;;  changes.

;; - The `embark-export' command tries to open a buffer in an appropriate
;;  major mode for the set of candidates. If the candidates are files
;;  export produces a Dired buffer; if they are buffers, you get an
;;  Ibuffer buffer; and if they are packages you get a buffer in
;;  package menu mode.

;; These are always available as "actions" (although they do not act
;; on just the current target but on all candidates) for embark-act and
;; are bound to O, L and E, respectively, in embark-general-map. This
;; means that you do not have to bind your own key bindings for these
;; (although you can, of course), just a key binding for `embark-act'
;; or `embark-act-noexit'.
