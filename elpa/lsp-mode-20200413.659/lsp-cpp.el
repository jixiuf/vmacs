;; ** Clang-tidy Flycheck integration (Clangd) **
;;
;; If you invoke `flycheck-display-error-explanation' on a
;; `clang-tidy' error (if Clangd is configured to show `clang-tidy'
;; diagnostics), Emacs will open a detailed explanation about the
;; message by querying the LLVM website. As an embedded web browser is
;; used to show the documentation, this feature requires that Emacs is
;; compiled with libxml2 support.
