;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides integration between Embark and Consult. To
;; use it, arrange for it to be loaded once both of those are loaded:

;; (with-eval-after-load 'consult
;;   (with-eval-after-load 'embark
;;     (require 'embark-consult)))

;; Some of the functionality here was previously contained in Embark
;; itself:

;; - Support for consult-buffer, so that you get the correct actions
;; for each type of entry in consult-buffer's list.

;; - Support for consult-line, consult-outline, consult-mark and
;; consult-global-mark, so that the insert and save actions don't
;; include a weird unicode character at the start of the line, and so
;; you can export from them to an occur buffer (where occur-edit-mode
;; works!).

;; Just load this package to get the above functionality, no further
;; configuration is necessary.

;; Additionally this package contains some functionality that has
;; never been in Embark: access to Consult preview from auto-updating
;; Embark Collect buffer that is associated to an active minibuffer
;; for a Consult command. For information on Consult preview, see
;; Consult's info manual or its readme on GitHub.

;; - `embark-consult-preview-at-point', a command to trigger Consult's
;; preview for the entry at point.

;; - `embark-consult-preview-minor-mode', a minor mode for Embark
;; Collect buffers that automatically previews the entry at point as
;; you move around.

;; If you always want the minor mode enabled whenever it possible use:

;; (add-hook 'embark-collect-mode-hook #'embark-consult-preview-minor-mode)

;; If you don't want the minor mode automatically on and prefer to
;; trigger the consult previews manually use this instead:

;; (define-key embark-collect-mode-map (kbd "C-j")
;;   #'embark-consult-preview-at-point)
