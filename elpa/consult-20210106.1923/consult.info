1 Introduction
**************

This package provides various commands based on the Emacs completion
function ‘completing-read’, in particular a more advanced buffer
switching command ‘consult-buffer’ which allows to select from buffers,
recent files and more.  Furthermore various search commands are
provided, like ‘consult-grep’ and ‘consult-line’, which resembles Swiper
(https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#swiper).

   The commands are compatible with completion systems based on the
standard Emacs ‘completing-read’ API, notably the default completion
system, Icomplete
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html),
Selectrum (https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum) and Embark’s
live-occur (https://github.com/oantolin/embark/).  If Icomplete is used,
it is recommended to install Icomplete-vertical
(https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical).  The completion system
specifics in this package are kept to a minimum.

   There are the Marginalia (https://github.com/minad/marginalia/) and
Embark (https://github.com/oantolin/embark/) packages, which can be
combined with Consult.  The ‘marginalia-mode’ enriches the completion
display with annotations.  The annotations show for example
documentation strings or file information.  Embark provides local
actions (like a context menu), which can be executed while selecting a
candidate in the minibuffer.  For example, when selecting a file, an
action to delete the file is offered.

   _Note_: If you use Ivy (https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy) or
Helm (https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm), you probably don’t need
Consult, since both packages already bring their own rich set of
additional commands.

File: consult.info,  Node: Virtual Buffers,  Next: Editing,  Up: Available commands

2.1 Virtual Buffers
===================

   • ‘consult-buffer’ (‘-other-window’, ‘-other-frame’): Enhanced
     version of ‘switch-to-buffer’ with support for virtual buffers.
     Supports live preview and recursive editing while previewing.  The
     command supports narrowing.  You can type ‘f SPC’ in order to
     narrow to recent files.  Ephemeral buffers can be shown by pressing
     ‘SPC’ - it works the same way as ‘switch-buffer’.  Supported
     narrowing keys:

        • b Buffers
        • f Files
        • m Bookmarks
        • p Project (only available if ‘consult-project-root-function’
          is configured)
        • v Views (only available if ‘consult-view-*-function’ is
          configured)

   • ‘consult-bookmark’: Select or create bookmark.  You might prefer
     the more powerful ‘consult-buffer’ instead, which includes
     bookmarks.
   • ‘consult-recent-file’ (‘-other-window’, ‘-other-frame’): Select a
     recent files.  You might prefer the more powerful ‘consult-buffer’
     instead, which includes recent files.


File: consult.info,  Node: Editing,  Next: Navigation,  Prev: Virtual Buffers,  Up: Available commands

2.2 Editing
===========

   • ‘consult-register’: Select from list of registers.
   • ‘consult-yank’, ‘consult-yank-pop’: Enhanced version of ‘yank’ and
     ‘yank-pop’ which allows selecting from the kill-ring.  Live preview
     is supported when selecting from the kill-ring.
   • ‘consult-kmacro’: Select macro from the macro ring and execute it.


File: consult.info,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Search,  Prev: Editing,  Up: Available commands

2.3 Navigation
==============

   • ‘consult-goto-line’: Jump to line number enhanced with live
     preview.  This is a drop-in replacement for ‘goto-line’.
   • ‘consult-mark’: Jump to a marker in the ‘mark-ring’.  Supports live
     preview and recursive editing.
   • ‘consult-global-mark’: Jump to a marker in the ‘global-mark-ring’.
     Supports live preview and recursive editing.
   • ‘consult-outline’: Jump to a heading of the outline.  Supports live
     preview and recursive editing.
   • ‘consult-imenu’: Jump to imenu item in the current buffer.
     Supports live preview, recursive editing and narrowing.
   • ‘consult-project-imenu’: Jump to imenu item in project buffers,
     with the same major mode as the current buffer.  Supports live
     preview, recursive editing and narrowing.  This feature has been
     inspired by imenu-anywhere
     (https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere).


File: consult.info,  Node: Search,  Next: Compilation errors,  Prev: Navigation,  Up: Available commands

2.4 Search
==========

   • ‘consult-line’: Enter search string and select from matching lines.
     Supports live preview and recursive editing.  The symbol at point
     and the recent isearch string are added to the "future history" and
     can be accessed by pressing ‘M-n’.
   • ‘consult-multi-occur’: Replacement for ‘multi-occur’ which uses
     ‘completing-read-multiple’.
   • ‘consult-grep’, ‘consult-ripgrep’, ‘consult-git-grep’: Search for
     regular expression in current directory.  Grep is invoked
     asynchronously, while you enter the search term.  You are required
     to enter at least ‘consult-async-min-input’ characters in order for
     the search to get started.  The input string is split into two
     parts, if the first character is a punctuation character, like ‘#’.
     For example ‘#grep-regexp#filter-string’, is split at the second
     ‘#’.  The string "grep-regexp" is passed to Grep, the
     "filter-string" is passed to the _fast_ Emacs filtering to further
     narrow down the list of matches.  This is particularily useful if
     you are using an advanced completion style like orderless.
     ‘consult-grep’ supports preview.  If
     ‘consult-project-root-function’ is configured and the function
     returns non-nil, ‘consult-grep’ searches the current project
     directory.  Otherwise the ‘default-directory’ is searched.  If
     ‘consult-grep’ is invoked with prefix argument, you can specify the
     directory manually, i.e., ‘C-u M-g r’.
   • ‘consult-find’, ‘consult-locate’: Find file by matching the path
     against a regexp.  Like ‘consult-grep’ either the project root or
     the current directory is used as root directory for the search.
     The input string is treated similarly to ‘consult-grep’, where the
     first part is passed to find, and the second part is used for Emacs
     filtering.  Note that ‘find’ uses wildcards, e.g. enter
     ‘*consult*’, to find all files containing the string "consult".  In
     case you want to use another search utility like ‘fd’, you can
     write wrapper command ‘my-fdfind’ (see below in the configuration
     example).

2.5 Compilation errors
======================

   • ‘consult-error’: Jump to an error.  Supports live preview and
     recursive editing.  In contrast to ‘consult-flycheck’ it shows the
     line and is more general since it is not tied to a specific
     backend.
   • ‘consult-flycheck’: Jump to flycheck error.  Supports live preview
     and recursive editing.  The command supports narrowing.  Press ‘e
     SPC’, ‘w SPC’, ‘i SPC’ to only show errors, warnings and infos
     respectively.  This command requires to install the additional
     ‘consult-flycheck.el’ package since the main ‘consult.el’ package
     only depends on Emacs core components.
   • ‘consult-flymake’: Jump to Flymake diagnostic, like
     ‘consult-flycheck’.


File: consult.info,  Node: Histories,  Next: Minor and Major modes,  Prev: Compilation errors,  Up: Available commands

2.6 Histories
=============

   • ‘consult-complex-command’: Select a command from the
     ‘command-history’.  This command is a ‘completing-read’ version of
     ‘repeat-complex-command’ and can also be considered a replacement
     for the ‘command-history’ command from chistory.el.
   • ‘consult-history’: Insert a string from the current buffer history.
     This command can be invoked from the minibuffer.  In that case the
     history stored in the minibuffer-history-variable is used.


File: consult.info,  Node: Minor and Major modes,  Next: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Histories,  Up: Available commands

2.7 Minor and Major modes
=========================

   • ‘consult-minor-mode-menu’: Enable/disable minor mode.  Supports
     narrowing to on/off/local/global modes by pressing ‘i/o/l/g SPC’
     respectively.
   • ‘consult-mode-command’: Run a command from the currently active
     minor or major modes.  Supports narrowing to
     local-minor/global-minor/major mode via the keys ‘l/g/m’.


File: consult.info,  Node: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Minor and Major modes,  Up: Available commands

2.8 Miscellaneous
=================

   • ‘consult-apropos’: Replacement for ‘apropos’ with completion.
   • ‘consult-file-externally’: Select a file and open it externally,
     e.g. using ‘xdg-open’ on Linux.
   • ‘consult-completion-in-region’: Function which can be used as
     ‘completion-in-region-function’.  This way, the minibuffer
     completion UI will be used for ‘completion-at-point’.  This
     function is particularily useful in combination with
     Icomplete-vertical, since Icomplete does not provide its own
     ‘completion-in-region-function’.  In contrast, Selectrum already
     comes with its own function.
   • ‘consult-theme’: Select a theme and disable all currently enabled
     themes.  Supports live preview of the theme while scrolling through
     the candidates.

3 Special features
******************

* Menu:

* Live previews::
* Narrowing to subsets::
* Asynchronous candidates and filtering::


File: consult.info,  Node: Live previews,  Next: Narrowing to subsets,  Up: Special features

3.1 Live previews
=================

Some Consult commands support live previews.  For example when you
scroll through the items of ‘consult-line’, the buffer will scroll to
the corresponding position.  It is possible to jump back and forth
between the minibuffer and the buffer to perform recursive editing while
the search is ongoing.  Previews must be explicitly enabled via
‘consult-preview-mode’.  Furthermore each command can be configured
individually to selectively enable/disable preview.


File: consult.info,  Node: Narrowing to subsets,  Next: Asynchronous candidates and filtering,  Prev: Live previews,  Up: Special features

3.2 Narrowing to subsets
========================

Consult has special support to narrow to candidate subsets.  When you
use the ‘consult-buffer’ command, you can press ‘b SPC’ and the list of
candidates will be restricted such that only buffers are shown.  If you
press ‘DEL’ afterwards, the full candidate list will be shown again.
Furthermore a narrowing/widening key can be configured which can be
pressed to achieve the same effect, see the configuration variables
‘consult-narrow-key’ and ‘consult-widen-key’.


File: consult.info,  Node: Asynchronous candidates and filtering,  Prev: Narrowing to subsets,  Up: Special features

3.3 Asynchronous candidates and filtering
=========================================

Consult has support for asynchronous generation of candidate lists.
This feature is used for example by ‘consult-grep’, where the list of
matches is generated dynamically while the user is typing a grep regular
expression.  Furthermore the found matches can then be narrowed using
the installed Emacs completion-style, which can be very powerful if you
are using for example the ‘orderless’ completion style.  This is
possible since part of the input string is treated as input to grep and
part of the input is used for filtering.  The input string is split at a
punctuation character, using a similar syntax as Perl regular
expressions.

   Examples:

   • ‘#defun’: Search for "defun" using grep.
   • ‘#defun#consult’: Search for "defun" using grep, filter with the
     word "consult".
   • ‘/defun/consult’: It is also possible to use other punctuation
     characters.
   • ‘#to#’: Force searching for "to" using grep, since the grep pattern
     must be longer than ‘consult-async-min-input’ characters by
     default.
   • ‘#defun -- --invert-match#’: Pass argument ‘--invert-match’ to
     grep.

4 Installation
**************

*NOTE: If you are using Selectrum, you MUST install the packages
selectrum, consult and consult-selectrum!*

   It is recommended to manage package configurations with
‘use-package’.  The Consult package only provides commands and does not
add any keybindings.  In order to use the enhanced commands, you must
configure the keybindings yourself.

   Note that there are three packages as of now: ‘consult.el’,
‘consult-selectrum.el’ and ‘consult-flycheck.el’.  Consult has been
split such that the main package ‘consult.el’ only depends on Emacs core
components.

4.3 Related packages
====================

*NOTE: If you are using Selectrum, you MUST install the packages
selectrum, consult and consult-selectrum!*

   It is recommended to install the following package combination:

   • consult: This package
   • consult-flycheck: Provides the consult-flycheck command
   • consult-selectrum: Provides integration with Selectrum
   • selectrum or icomplete-vertical: Vertical completion systems
   • marginalia: Annotations for the completion candidates
   • embark: Action commands, which can act on the completion candidates
   • orderless: Completion style, Flexible candidate filtering
   • prescient: Frecency-based candidate sorting, also offers filtering

   Note that all packages are independent and can potentially be
exchanged with alternative components, since there exist no hard
dependencies.  Furthermore it is possible to get started with only
Selectrum and Consult and add more components later to the mix.
